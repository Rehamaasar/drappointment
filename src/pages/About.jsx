        <li>See the type of specialty they need</li>
        <li>Send a request to book an appointment</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>For the Project</h2>
      <p>
        This website is part of our Web Programming course project. It focuses
        on front-end only (no real backend), using React and simple data.
